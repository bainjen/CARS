# Combine Automation Report Simulator (CARS)

Description placeholder

## Installation and running locally:

Load the dependencies of the application:

```sh
cd path/to/CARS
yarn #npm install
```

Initialize amplify backend and create a new development environment from the amplify instructions from the CLI:

```sh
amplify init
```

The final output from amplify init outputs your GraphQL endpoint and your GraphQL API key. Save these values in `CARS/amplify/backend/function/runSimulations/src/.env`

```txt
# CARS/amplify/backend/function/runSimulations/src/.env

GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="<your GraphQL endpoint>"
GRAPHQL_API_KEY="<your GraphQL API key>"
```

Push your API and lambda function to AWS:

```sh
amplify push
```

**To run the application locally**

```sh
yarn start #npm run start
```

## Using the app:

Combine configurations are created on the React frontend and saved to the DynamoDB backend.

Simulations are run using an hourly AWS lambda function which can be mocked locally by running:

```sh
amplify mock function runSimulations
```

This function takes in each combine configuration from the database and runs a simulation, inputting data to the Simulation table and updating the current number of simulation runs on each configuration.
