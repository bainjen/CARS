# Stack

- Create React App (familiar)
- Responsive Design (familiar)
- Context API (limited knowledge)
- Amplify (completely new) -- AWS Amplify is a set of products and tools that enables mobile and front-end web developers to build and deploy secure, scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS.
- GraphQL API (limited knowledge) -- querying language - get all needed data in single endpoint used to fetch data from multiple sources -- consists of SCHEMA, QUERIES, MUTATIONS, RESOLVERS
- DynamoDB (completely new)
- AWS Lambda backend (completely new) Lambda function resolvers allow you to write your AppSync resolver logic in JavaScript.

* schedule recurring tests using lambda functions

# Initial Approach

Begin with what I know (front-end)
Work out math and logistics
Research frameworks I don't know (particularly aws)
Attempt to connect the backend

# Data Relationships

one user ->
can have many configurations
configurations ->
will have many runs (tests)
each run ->
will have a unique result

- user will input configuration(s) from the front-end

- upon submission, configuration will be stored in the database

- each hour, a test will run on each configuration using Lambda function

- test result should log data to the database

- on front end, user should be able to fetch the data results that are logged from tests

- bonus would be analyzing data in meaningful way, especially as available data grows

# basics of combine

- wheel size: 60 inch
- auger length: 8.7 feet --> 240 passes @ 5min each (auger takes up)
- fuel type: diesel --> 20 gallons per 10 acres (\$350)
- 1 pass is approx 2,087.1 feet
- pretending there is not a turn radius -- in real life we would have to cut off corners and have fancy meneuvering to turn around. Base model will ignore this reality and snake around tightly.

# Assignment from ATG

Assignment: CARS “Combine Automation Report Simulator”
Requirements:

• Create React App
• Responsive Design
• Context API state management
• GraphQL API Schema
• DynamoDB
• AWS lambda backend functions
\*For AWS services please use Amplify
Instructions:
You have been assigned to create a prototype simulation for the future of agriculture
harvesting. To prove the concept of autonomous combines [ harvesting tractor], you must build
a react wizard component allowing users to configure their own autonomous combine and add
that configuration onto a database. All combines in the database will have scheduled simulation
test ran to log the functionality and operation of each combine to measure its efficiency
through harvesting a 10-acre square field.
Each combine is tested every hour with randomly generated obstacles placed on the square
field. The test should account for the obstacles and calculate efficiency for each combine and
log the values onto the database. It is important to note that the combines can follow any
pattern but cannot move backwards.
The wizard’s input is:

1. Wheel Size [ To calculate time taken, considering all combines operate at the same
   speed]
2. Combine Stalk Auger length [ to calculate the number of passes made to plane the field]
3. Fuel Type:
   a. Electrical
   b. Diesel
   Constraints and Assumptions
4. A Base Combine weighs 53,000 pounds, with 60-inch wheels, and 8.7 feet wide auger,
   making 240 passes to plane a 10-acre square field with each pass taking 5 min. The base
   fuel type is Diesel with a fuel consumption per 10 acres of 20 gallons. Costing \$350 per
   10 acres.

5. Increase in Wheel Size by 1-inch results in weight increase by 5% but a time reduction of
   3%.
6. Electric Combines are more costly per 10 acres by 25% at the start but with each run
   reducing cost by 0.5 % consistently. Diesel is a fixed cost. Regardless of fuel type the
   cost per 10 acres is a factor of weight with a linear relationship.
7. Auger length can be altered from the base unit by 1 foot increments up to a maximum
   auger length of 25.7 feet. 1 increment increase results in weight increase by 8%.
8. 3 obstacles [ 1ft x 1ft rock ] are to be placed randomly on the field per run and the
   combines must transverse around them. The point of this exercise is calculating the
   most efficient path to plane the field with least amount of time.
9. Make and state any other reasonable assumptions made for this project
   Data Logging
   Each hourly test generates a report added onto the database for each combine providing:
10. Time taken to plane the field
11. Percentage of field chosen to cover
12. Cost per run
13. Total Efficiency
    Total Efficiency is:
    e = Average [
    600
    time taken(mins)

- percent of field chosen to cover +
  run cost
  350
  ]

Note: This test is designed to challenge your capabilities and perseverance, ATG understands
the difficulty of this test to be completed within 2 weeks. The team is looking for talent that
understands the process in tackling this test not only the end product presented, as the
internship pertains roles working indirectly with robotics.
Individuals are expected to work on their own, all candidates that make it to the follow up
interview will be expected to explain their solution.

The Test submission is due November 25, 2020. Once Completed, upload the repository onto
GitHub and send the repository link to: ahmed@atgpharma.com
